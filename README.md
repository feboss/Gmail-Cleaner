# Gmail-cleaner
This script is in development. Right now it can get the top 10 senders in a users gmail inbox.
## Setup
This script requires you to [create a Google Cloud Platform Project and enable the Gmail api](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project). The credentials must be saved in a credentials.json file in the project directory.
